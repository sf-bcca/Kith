# Track: Interactive Family Tree Visualization

## Overview
Connect the dynamic `FamilyMember` data model to the `FamilyTreeView` and implement interactive tree navigation.

## Objectives
- Render the family tree dynamically using data from `FamilyService`.
- Implement a "Focus Person" centered view showing ancestry and descendants.
- Enable interactive navigation (selecting a member to make them the new focus).
- Replace static placeholders with real member data.

## Context
- **Data Source:** `FamilyService`
- **Component:** `FamilyTreeView.tsx`
- **Visuals:** Maintain the existing aesthetic but make it data-driven.
