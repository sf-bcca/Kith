# Plan: DNA Map Visualization

## Phase 1: Foundation & Data Preparation
- [x] Create a location lookup utility for mock data locations. `[x]`
- [x] Add unit tests for location mapping logic. `[x]`
- [x] Implement `getGeographicData` in a new `LocationService` or update `TreeService`. `[x]`

## Phase 2: Basic Map Rendering
- [x] Create a base SVG World Map component. `[x]`
- [x] Plot birthplaces on the map based on member data. `[x]`
- [x] Implement basic tooltips or labels for locations. `[x]`

## Phase 3: Migration Paths & Interactivity
- [x] Draw "Migration Paths" (arcs) between parents and children birthplaces. `[x]`
- [x] Implement location selection to show members in a side panel or modal. `[x]`
- [x] Add basic zoom/pan controls to the SVG map. `[x]`

## Phase 4: Refinement & Polishing
- [x] Enhance visuals with gradients and animations for migration paths. `[x]`
- [x] Ensure mobile responsiveness and touch friendliness. `[x]`
- [x] Final verification and checkpoint. `[x]`
